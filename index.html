                    <p class="photo-para">My dad worked at JFK airport for 30+ years before he retired. He was the
                        breadwinner, had all the finance under control in the household. My dad also
                        was a handy man as well. Everytime when something go wrong with the house, he'll resolve the
                        issue before calling someone which he rarely did. What my dad would always do on the side as a side hustle was
                        fix people cars in front our house or in our backyard, even during cold weather. Mostly every Saturdays when he's off from work, my dad would have his get togethers among his friends to play
                        cards, drink and watch TV. And on Sundays he go to church or listen to his spiritual radio
                        station all day long while at home. And after his retirement, mostly everyday he'll have his get togethers as he lived out his life until he was unable to due to his health struggles. Now that my dad is gone, the household would never be the
                        same again, and of course no one can't replace him. But I'm sure he's in heaven with the rest of
                        his friends that done passed on doing what he usually does when he get together with them. 
                        He'll be miss always.</p>

            <p class="para_2"> Lord Jesus Christ, we command to you our brother Awlwyn, who was reborn by
                water and the Spirit in Holy Baptism. Grant that his death may recall to us your victory over
                death, and be an occasion for us to renew our trust in your Fatherâ€™s love. Give us, we pray, the
                faith to follow where you have led the way; and where you live and reign with the Father and the
                Holy Spirit, to the ages of ages. Amen</p>
